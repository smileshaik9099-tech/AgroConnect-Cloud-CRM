---

## **1. SIMPLE PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **1.1 Core Business Problem**

Agricultural service companies face basic organizational challenges in managing their farmer customers and tracking agricultural support services:

**Primary Issues:**
- **Scattered Farmer Information:** Customer contact details, farm information, and service history stored in Excel sheets or paper records
- **Poor Service Tracking:** No systematic way to track which services have been provided to which farmers
- **Manual Seasonal Planning:** Crop seasons and agricultural activities managed manually without proper scheduling
- **Limited Communication:** No organized system for communicating with farmers about services, products, or seasonal advice
- **No Performance Metrics:** Lack of reports on service delivery, farmer engagement, and business performance

### **1.2 Target User Problems**

**Agricultural Service Representatives:**
- Cannot easily access farmer contact information and service history
- Struggle to track which farmers need follow-up visits or services
- Manual scheduling of seasonal agricultural support activities
- Difficulty coordinating with team members about farmer service status
- No mobile access to farmer information when visiting farms

**Service Managers:**
- No visibility into team performance and farmer engagement metrics
- Cannot track service delivery trends or identify high-value farmers
- Manual reporting and performance tracking processes
- Difficulty planning resource allocation across different agricultural seasons
- No systematic approach to farmer relationship management

**Farmers (Customers):**
- Inconsistent communication about available services and seasonal recommendations
- No organized way to request services or track service history
- Limited access to agricultural advice and product recommendations
- Unclear about service schedules and follow-up activities

**Company Administrators:**
- Manual user management and data entry processes
- No centralized database of farmer information and service records
- Limited ability to generate business reports and performance metrics
- Difficulty maintaining data quality and consistency across the organization

### **1.3 Business Impact**

**Current State Challenges:**
- **30% of farmer contacts** are lost or outdated due to manual record keeping
- **Agricultural service reps spend 40% of their time** searching for farmer information instead of providing services
- **25% of scheduled service visits** are missed due to poor scheduling and tracking systems
- **No visibility into service profitability** or farmer lifetime value
- **Manual reporting takes 2 days per month** instead of real-time insights
